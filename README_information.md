1. Commands for initialization
    npm create vite@latest
    ... name your project (movie_front_end in this case) (at the end of the processes it will create a folder with the same name as the project)

2. Go to movie_front_end directory
    npm install
    This will read the dependencies from package.json and load them in the local machine
    a folder called node_modules will be creates

3. File Information:
    index.html - The react code is injected in this file (inside the div having the id "root")

    main.jsx - main react stuff is rendered here

    app.jsx - code is written here
    
4. To run the react application
    npm run dev

5. It is a good practice while working with react that you create components in separate files
    Create a folder in the src folder can create files in it
